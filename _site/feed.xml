<h3 id="from-formality-to-flexibility-a-personal-journey"><strong>From Formality to Flexibility: A Personal Journey</strong></h3>

<p>In the realm of career development, the CV (Curriculum Vitae) stands as the gateway to opportunities. Its significance is monumental, yet its evolution has been slow, particularly in places like Germany where traditional formats and “Zeugnisse” (formal certificates and testimonials) long dictated the narrative. But change is in the air, and it’s a change I’ve embraced with open arms.</p>

<p>Like many, I struggled with the rigid frameworks of formal resumes. The emphasis on certificates over skills felt restrictive, misrepresenting the true capabilities of a candidate. Thankfully, the tide is turning towards more modern, skill-centric resumes, a shift that aligns perfectly with today’s dynamic job market.</p>

<h3 id="embracing-latex-crafting-the-perfect-cv"><strong>Embracing LaTeX: Crafting the Perfect CV</strong></h3>

<p>In previous blog posts, we explored essential aspects of modern development such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment and Modern Software Development with a Scrum-Focused Approach.</p>

<p>Today, we’ll dive into the practicality of Python for interacting with RESTful APIs, specifically leveraging the <strong>requests</strong> library.
The integration of REST APIs is a common theme in today’s interconnected world and Python, with its user-friendly ecosystem, makes it simple and effective.</p>

<p>We’ll start by demonstrating how to use <strong>requests</strong> with a CLI using <strong>argparse</strong>, then introduce <strong>typer</strong>, a newer library that simplifies the creation of CLI programs.</p>

<h3 id="interacting-with-rest-apis-using-requests">Interacting with REST APIs using requests</h3>

<p>Here’s a brief snippet that fetches users from a specific endpoint:</p>

<h3 id="modernizing-cli-with-typer">Modernizing CLI with typer</h3>
<p>Let’s transition to using <strong>typer</strong>, a modern and intuitive library for crafting CLI tools.</p>

<p><strong>Typer</strong> stands out for its ability to effortlessly transform functions into CLI commands using decorators, leveraging type annotations and docstrings to create intuitive and informative interfaces:</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">typer</span>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are vital aspects of modern software development. They encourage faster, more reliable iterations and ensure that the product can be released reliably at any time. This article focuses primarily on GitHub Actions but will touch upon other platforms such as Jenkins, CircleCI, and GitLab.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-cicd">Understanding CI/CD</h2>
<p>Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers’ working copies to a shared mainline multiple times a day. It helps identify integration issues early, enhances code quality, and reduces the time it takes to get a product ready for release.</p>

<p>Continuous Deployment (CD) is the subsequent step in this workflow, involving automatic deployment of integrated changes to the production environment. It ensures that you can rely on an automated process to release your software, reducing the overall time to market.</p>

<h2 id="github-actions-the-basics">GitHub Actions: The Basics</h2>
<p>GitHub Actions is an automation tool that allows you to build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. It provides developers with the ability to automate, customize, and execute their software development workflows in the same place they manage code.</p>

<h2 id="examples-of-github-actions">Examples of GitHub Actions</h2>
<h3 id="running-tests">Running Tests</h3>

<p>Running tests automatically is a common use case for GitHub Actions in CI/CD pipelines. The example below demonstrates a simple setup for running tests whenever changes are pushed to the repository.</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Run Tests</span>

        <span class="s">npm test</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="building-and-deploying-docker-images">Building and Deploying Docker Images</h3>

<p>GitHub Actions can be utilized to build Docker images and push them to a Docker registry. The example below demonstrates this process. We are building a Docker image whenever changes are pushed to the master branch, tagging the image with the Git commit SHA, and pushing the image to Docker Hub</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Build and Deploy Docker Image</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The logic in this workflow can be tailored based on the branch from which the changes are being pushed. For instance, images pushed from the develop branch might be tagged as development and pushed to a different Docker registry or with different metadata.</p>

<h2 id="other-cicd-tools-jenkins-circleci-and-gitlab">Other CI/CD Tools: Jenkins, CircleCI, and GitLab</h2>
<p>While GitHub Actions is a powerful and flexible tool, other platforms also offer robust CI/CD capabilities.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Jenkins</strong>: An open-source tool known for its robust server-based deployment and CI features. Jenkins offers great customization options with a vast plugin ecosystem.</li>
  <li><strong>CircleCI</strong>: Noted for its excellent Docker support, CircleCI allows for cloud-based CI/CD pipelines that are language-agnostic.</li>
  <li><strong>GitLab</strong>: Similar to GitHub in many ways, GitLab stands out with its all-in-one approach, integrating source code management, project planning, CI/CD, and monitoring into a single unified platform.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>CI/CD are indispensable elements of modern software development, offering advantages in terms of code quality, delivery speed, and overall workflow efficiency. With tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI, and GitLab, you can automate and streamline your processes, ultimately delivering better products faster.</p>]]></content><author><name>Chris Langhans</name></author><category term="Software Development" /><category term="CI/CD" /><category term="git" /><category term="github actions" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment: Cornerstones of Modern Development]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Modern Software Development Scrum</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023/08/Modern-Software-Development-Scrum/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Modern Software Development Scrum" /><published>2023-08-03T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2023-08-03T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023/08/Modern-Software-Development-Scrum</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023/08/Modern-Software-Development-Scrum/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="modern-software-development-a-scrum-focused-approach">Modern Software Development: A Scrum-Focused Approach</h1>

<p>In an age of rapid digital evolution, software development methods have become pivotal to meeting ever-changing customer needs and market demands. The waterfall model, once a software development mainstay, has been largely supplanted by more dynamic, iterative frameworks, most notably, Scrum.</p>

<p>Scrum, an agile development framework, prioritizes collaboration, self-organization, and flexibility, enabling teams to swiftly deliver value and adapt to emerging requirements. But what does Scrum entail, and how do the various roles in software development—Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team roles like Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Data Engineer, Cloud Architect, UX Designer, DevOps, and more—contribute to its application? Let’s explore.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-scrum">What is Scrum?</h2>

<p>Scrum is an iterative and incremental framework designed to manage complex projects, primarily in software development. It divides large tasks into smaller chunks, allowing teams to focus on delivering functional software in short timeframes (usually two to four weeks), known as “Sprints.”</p>

<p>Scrum’s main components are the Scrum Team (comprising the Product Owner, the Scrum Master, and the Development Team), the Product Backlog, the Sprint Backlog, and the increments or deliverables.</p>

<h3 id="scrum-roles">Scrum Roles</h3>

<p><strong>1. The Scrum Master</strong></p>

<p>The Scrum Master’s role is to coach and guide the team in understanding and implementing the Scrum principles. They help eliminate any obstacles that might hinder the team’s progress and facilitate communication among the team members and stakeholders. The Scrum Master ensures that the Scrum process is understood, enacted, and improved continuously.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Product Owner</strong></p>

<p>The Product Owner (PO) is responsible for managing the Product Backlog and ensuring that the product vision aligns with the stakeholders’ expectations. The PO decides the priority of the Backlog items for each Sprint and communicates these priorities to the team.</p>

<p><strong>3. The Development Team</strong></p>

<p>The Development Team is a self-organizing, cross-functional group responsible for delivering increments at the end of each Sprint.
This team includes various roles, each with a specific contribution, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Frontend Developer:</strong> This role focuses on what users interact with - the user interface. They implement design features, fix bugs, optimize applications for speed and scalability, and ensure web design is mobile-ready.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Backend Developer:</strong> Backend developers work on the server-side, dealing with the application, server, and database. They create APIs, write server scripts, and handle data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data Engineer:</strong> The data engineer’s main role is to find trends in datasets and develop algorithms to make raw data more useful to the enterprise. This could be within the context of customer trends, operational efficiency, or other business needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cloud Architect:</strong> A cloud architect manages an organization’s cloud computing architecture. They work on cloud application design, cloud management and monitoring, and enterprise cloud deployment strategies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Product Backlog:</strong> This is an ordered list of everything necessary for the product, maintained and refined by the Product Owner.</li>
  <li><strong>Sprint Backlog:</strong> A set of items chosen from the Product Backlog for the Sprint.</li>
  <li><strong>Sprint:</strong> A time-boxed event (often 2 weeks) where specific work is completed and made ready for review.</li>
  <li><strong>Daily Scrum:</strong> A daily 15-minute event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and align for the next 24 hours.</li>
  <li><strong>Sprint Review:</strong> A review of the increment with stakeholders at the end of the Sprint to get feedback and update the Product Backlog.</li>
  <li><strong>Sprint Retrospective:</strong> A meeting held at the end of each Sprint where the team reflects on the past Sprint to improve processes and performance for the future.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="beyond-single-team-scrum-scaled-agile-and-scrum-of-scrums">Beyond Single Team Scrum: Scaled Agile and Scrum of Scrums</h2>

<p>Scrum is excellent for small to mid-sized teams. But what about larger organizations where multiple teams work on the same product? Here, we need frameworks to scale Scrum practices, like the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) or Scrum of Scrums.</p>

<p><strong>Scrum of Scrums (SoS):</strong> SoS is a technique used for scaling Scrum up to large groups. In essence, it operates as a Scrum Team of Scrum Teams. Each team designates a member to participate in the daily Scrum of Scrums meeting, discussing progress, plans, and impediments.</p>

<p><strong>Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe):</strong> SAFe provides a comprehensive framework for scaling Agile practices across an enterprise. It supports alignment, collaboration, and delivery across large numbers of Agile teams and combines Agile, Lean, and DevOps principles into a single approach.</p>]]></content><author><name>Chris Langhans</name></author><category term="Software Development" /><category term="Agile Frameworks" /><category term="Project Management" /><category term="software" /><category term="agile" /><category term="project management" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern Software Development: A Scrum-Focused Approach]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mastering Git Branching Models</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023/08/Mastering-Git-Branching-Models/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mastering Git Branching Models" /><published>2023-08-01T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2023-08-01T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023/08/Mastering-Git-Branching-Models</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023/08/Mastering-Git-Branching-Models/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="mastering-git-branching-models-for-a-smooth-development-workflow">Mastering Git Branching Models for a Smooth Development Workflow</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Git, a Version Control System (VCS), is a developer’s indispensable tool. It allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without stepping on each other’s toes. A fundamental component of Git is its branching model. Branching is akin to creating parallel universes within your codebase where different features or bug fixes can be worked on independently. It enhances code management and workflow in development processes.</p>

<p>In this post, we will explore what branching models are, discuss popular branching strategies, and learn how to incorporate branch protections in Git. We’ll walk through a simplified process involving development, staging, and release branches. Finally, we will understand how tags play a crucial role in this setting.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-branching-model">What is a Branching Model?</h2>

<p>A Git branching model is a set of conventions or rules that projects follow to manage branches in Git repositories. These models ensure that your development process is organized, efficient, and easy to navigate. They dictate when, why, and how branches are created, named, used, and deleted.</p>

<h2 id="git-branching-strategies">Git Branching Strategies</h2>

<p>One of the most popular branching strategies is the <strong>Git Flow</strong> model. This model includes five types of branches: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">feature</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">release</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hotfix</code>. However, to keep things simple, we will focus on a more streamlined process that involves three main branches: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">development</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">staging</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Development Branch</strong>: This is where developers create and commit their code. Each new feature or bug fix should have its own branch that stems from development, known as a feature branch. Once the work is complete and tested, the feature branch is merged back into the development branch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Staging Branch</strong>: Once the features in the development branch are ready for more rigorous testing, they are merged into the staging branch. The staging branch mirrors the production environment and serves as the final testing ground before the changes go live.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Master Branch</strong>: After thoroughly testing in the staging branch, the code is merged into the master branch and goes into production. The master branch always reflects the production-ready state.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="incorporating-branch-protections">Incorporating Branch Protections</h2>

<p>To maintain the sanctity of our branches and ensure that only thoroughly tested and reviewed code makes it to production, we can use <strong>branch protection rules</strong> in Git. These rules provide various controls like preventing force pushes, requiring pull request reviews before merging, and necessitating status checks to pass before allowing changes to be merged.</p>

<p>For instance, you could set up rules that require code review before changes can be merged into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">staging</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branches. This ensures that your code is checked for quality and correctness, enhancing your code’s reliability and maintainability.</p>

<h2 id="incorporating-tags">Incorporating Tags</h2>

<p>In Git, <strong>tags</strong> are references to specific points in your repository’s history. They are typically used to capture a point in history that marks a version release (v1.0, v1.1, and so on).</p>

<p>When the code is ready to be released into production (i.e., when it’s merged into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch), a tag is created to indicate the release version. It’s a good practice to include additional information, such as release notes, with your tags. If a critical bug is found in production, tags make it easy to rollback to a previous, stable version of your codebase.</p>

<h2 id="the-workflow-a-basic-web-application">The Workflow: A Basic Web Application</h2>

<p>Let’s map these concepts to a typical workflow while developing a basic web application.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Development</strong>: When a developer starts working on a new feature, say a user authentication system, they create a new branch from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">development</code>, called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">feature/user-auth</code>. They make their changes, commits, and test locally on this branch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Code Review and Merge</strong>: After completing the feature, they create a pull request to merge <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">feature/user-auth</code> into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">development</code>. Their team reviews the code. If everything checks out, the branch is merged.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Staging</strong>: Periodically, or when enough features are ready, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">development</code> branch is merged into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">staging</code>. The application on the staging branch is then deployed to a staging environment, which closely mirrors production. Rigorous testing is performed in this environment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Release</strong>: After successful testing, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">staging</code> branch is merged into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>. A tag is created to mark the new release. The application is then deployed to production using the code in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hotfixes</strong>: If a critical bug is found in production, a hotfix branch is created from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>, the bug is fixed, and the branch is directly merged back into both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">development</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>With these practices, you can ensure your development process is smooth, efficient, and less error-prone. It allows your team to work on independent features simultaneously, ensures code quality, and provides a safety net in case things go wrong.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Mastering Git branching models is essential for managing a well-organized, efficient, and error-free development process. With the right branching strategies, branch protection rules, and the use of tags, your team can work independently and concurrently, ensure code quality, and maintain a seamless delivery pipeline. Remember, the exact workflow may vary based on your team’s needs and the project’s complexity. However, the principles remain the same: isolate development work, protect your main branches, and tag your releases. Happy coding!</p>]]></content><author><name>Chris Langhans</name></author><category term="Software Development" /><category term="software" /><category term="git" /><category term="branches" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mastering Git Branching Models for a Smooth Development Workflow]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Semantic Versioning</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023/08/Semantic-Versioning/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Semantic Versioning" /><published>2023-08-01T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2023-08-01T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023/08/Semantic-Versioning</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023/08/Semantic-Versioning/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="everything-starts-with-a-good-resume">Everything starts with a good resume</h1>

<h1 id="understanding-semantic-versioning-and-its-importance-in-git-branching-models">Understanding Semantic Versioning and Its Importance in Git Branching Models</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In our previous post, we discussed Git branching models and touched on how tags are used to mark specific points in a repository’s history, often to denote version releases. This time, we’re diving deeper into the concept of versioning - specifically, Semantic Versioning - and how it fits into the Git branching model.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-semantic-versioning">What is Semantic Versioning?</h2>

<p>Semantic Versioning, or SemVer, is a versioning scheme for software that aims to convey meaning about the underlying changes in a release. It provides a universal standard of structuring version numbers.</p>

<p>A SemVer-compatible version number is composed of three parts: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>MAJOR</strong>: This number is incremented when you make incompatible API changes. This indicates that the new version might break the existing code that uses this API, and manual intervention might be needed to update the code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>MINOR</strong>: This number is incremented when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner. The users of your API can benefit from the new features without making any changes to their existing code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>PATCH</strong>: This number is incremented when you make backward-compatible bug fixes. This is generally safe to update without worrying about breaking anything.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are also available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format, like 1.0.0-alpha or 1.0.0+20130313144700.</p>

<p>One of the essential principles of Semantic Versioning is that a version, once released, should be <strong>immutable</strong>. This means that no changes should be made to the version after it has been released. If you need to make changes, then it’s important to release a new version.
This principle guarantees that every version is a consistent and reliable snapshot of the software at a specific point in time.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-semantic-versioning-important">Why is Semantic Versioning Important?</h2>

<p>Semantic Versioning gives users of your software more insight into what is happening with each new release. It allows them to understand the potential impact of updating to a new version and plan accordingly.</p>

<p>Semantic versioning is particularly useful in a collaborative coding environment as it helps to communicate the risk and the size of changes between different versions of a software or a library.</p>

<h2 id="semantic-versioning-in-the-context-of-git-branching-models">Semantic Versioning in the Context of Git Branching Models</h2>

<p>Semantic Versioning and Git branching models are closely related. As discussed in our previous post, the Git branching model enables parallel lines of development and helps streamline the software release process. When integrated with Semantic Versioning, it makes the process more informative and efficient.</p>

<p>When a new feature, bug fix, or breaking change is introduced into the codebase, it typically goes through the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">development</code> -&gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">staging</code> -&gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> workflow. At the point when changes are merged into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch and are ready to be released, a new tag is created.</p>

<p>This tag is where Semantic Versioning comes into play. By adhering to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format, the tag conveys important information about what the release encompasses. If the code changes include a new feature that doesn’t break any existing functionality, for instance, the MINOR version would be incremented. If a bug was fixed, the PATCH version would be incremented. And if there were changes that broke backward compatibility, the MAJOR version would be incremented.</p>

<p>For example, if the current version of the application is at 2.3.4 and a new backward-compatible feature is added and ready to be released, the new tag would be 2.4.0.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Understanding Semantic Versioning is essential for managing software versions effectively. It not only provides a standard way of versioning but also communicates the nature of updates to the users. When combined with Git branching models, Semantic Versioning enhances the software development and release process, making it more robust, predictable, and efficient. Remember, effective version management can be as crucial as the code itself in a software project’s success.</p>]]></content><author><name>Chris Langhans</name></author><category term="career" /><category term="software" /><category term="linux" /><category term="latex" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everything starts with a good resume]]></summary></entry></feed>
