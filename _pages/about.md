Hello, and welcome! I'm **Chris Langhans**, a Senior Software Engineer with an enduring passion for
software development.

## My Journey

My fascination with software development ignited over two decades ago, around the age of 17, when I
delved into programming 8-bit microcontrollers. This early spark propelled me to pursue formal
education in the field, culminating in a B.Eng and M.Sc. in Computer Engineering. My professional
journey commenced as an Embedded Software Developer, a role that laid the foundation for the diverse
experiences and expertise I've garnered over the years. From tackling the intricacies of embedded
systems to exploring broader software domains, I've consistently sought to master the art of
crafting efficient and robust software.

## Why I Blog

Software development is an ever-evolving field. Through this blog, not only do I aim to share
insights from my journey in the software world and hone my writing skills, but I also view this
platform as a reference for myselfâ€”a collection of topics and knowledge I would want to read. My
objective is to discuss the latest in tools, techniques, and best practices, hoping to serve as a
valuable resource for fellow developers, enthusiasts, and me.

## Topics I Target
